Notes for Getting Tensorflow to Work on Pop_OS 18.04

After making sure that the nvidia drivers are installed (which should be automatic
for Pop), go here: https://support.system76.com/articles/cuda/

Then run the following commands:

sudo apt install system76-cuda-10.0
sudo apt install system76-cudnn-10.1

Then within the virtual python environment run the following to get tensorflow 2.0.0,
also get tensorflow_probability.:

pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
pip install --upgrade tensorflow-probability

Keras is always good to have for easy model creation and checking to make sure certain packages
are loaded correctly:

pip install --upgrade keras
